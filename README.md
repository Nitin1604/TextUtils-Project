and characters are there in a sentences and also there is a summary of words that how 
much time will take to read the whole sentences.

TextUtils project in Dark mode
_______________________________________________________________________________________
****About us section****
_______________________________________________________________________________________
In this project i have made this project with the help of React JS , the color of the 
About Us component is in yellow color and font color is in white color 
______________________________________________________________________________________
****light mode to dark mode**** 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
When going from light mode to dark mode then alert message will come informing to the 
user that the web page has been converted to light mode and same for when going from
light mode to dark mode then alert message will come informing to the user that dark 
mode has been enabled.
____________________________________________________________________________________
I have inserted five buttons that are
____________________________________________________________________________________
****"Convert to Uppercase"**** 
____________________________________________________________________________________
****"Convert to Lowercase"**** 
____________________________________________________________________________________
****"Clear Text"****  
____________________________________________________________________________________
****"Copy Text"**** 
____________________________________________________________________________________
****"Remove Extra Spaces"****
____________________________________________________________________________________
These are only works when these five buttons
are not disabled that means user can only write in the text area when these buttons are
not disabled and when these five buttons are disabled then the user can't write in the 
text area.
