**TextUtils Project****
**** TextUtils project in Light mode ****
****About us section****
I have made this project with the help of React JS which is the frameworks of JavaScript.
In this project i have created a navbar which contains components home and about 
I have also created a dark mode toggle button which can be switch between dark mode and
light mode. When web page is in light mode then the color of background is white and 
font color is black. About us has three collaspse which can be move upside and downside
All three collaspse are moving upside and downside when clicking on arrow button which can 
turn upside when we want to show the text and turn downside when we want to hide the text

 ****Text Form****
 In this section i have created a text area in which anything can be written for testing 
 of these five buttons : "Convert to Uppercase" , "Convert to Lowercase" , "Clear Text" , 
 "Copy Text" , "Remove Extra Spaces" 
 
 **Convert to Uppercase**
 Any text written in text area will converted to uppercase when clicking on this button.
 
 **Convert to Lowercase**
 Any text written in text area will converted to lowercase when clicking on this button.
 
 **Clear Text**
 Any text written in text area will are cleared when clicking on this button.
 
 **Copy Text**
 Any text written in text area will be copied when clicking on this button.
 
 **Remove Extra Spaces**
 Any text written in text area will remove all extra spaces in between any two or more then two words when clicking on this button.

**Text Summary below the four buttons that i have described above**
Below these four buttons i have inserted a text summary that indicates how many words and characters are there in a sentences and 
also there is a summary of words that how much time will take to read the whole sentences.

Finally there is preview of words and sentences at the bottom of the web page 
**Nothing to preview** is only mentioned when there is no words and sentence
in the text area. When user is continously typing in the text area then the 
preview will also change continously with typing.
